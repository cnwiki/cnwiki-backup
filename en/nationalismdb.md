  ## Type-specific tags
Each record under this category has four essential tags: the city, provice/state, country/region, and continent in which the movement occured. If the movement occured on a college campus or local landmark, then that location will also become a tag. For instance, the [University of Queensland protests](/nationalismdb/university-of-queensland-protests) entry will have the following tagsï¼š
- [University of Queensland](/t/university%20of%20queensland)
- [Brisbane](/t/brisbane)
- [Queensland](/t/queensland)
- [Australia](/t/australia)
- [Oceania](/t/oceania)

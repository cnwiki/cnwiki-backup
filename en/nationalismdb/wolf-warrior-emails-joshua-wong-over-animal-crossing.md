After screenshots of Hong Kong protestors using Animal Crossing, a console game for the Switch by Nintendo, to voice their dissent against the Chinese and Hong Kong government began to circulate online, the Chinese authorities promptly banned the sale of the game on Taobao and Xianyu (咸鱼, another C2C marketplace created by the same company behind Taobao). This prompted a wolf warrior to send an expletive-laden email to Joshua Wong, blaming him for causing the ban. 
Notably, in the email, the sender asserts that he is Joshua Wong's father, yet he also curses Wong's family to death in the title. Additionally, he wished for the graves of Wong's ancestors to "enter the ocean," a nonsensical phrase which is most likely to be a poor attempt to insult. This inadvertent attack on his own family is a prime example of the lack of intelligence displayed by most wolf warriors.

## Translation
**Title:** Although the Qingming Festival has already passed, I still pray that your family dies.

**Body:** Fuck your playing this game, always perpetrating Satan's work. Now Animal Crossing is banned because of this. Are you a fucking retard? Oh I'm sorry, you don't deserve it! I have to say, you're as impressive as a female cow riding a rocket and entering space, cuz' you caused a game to be banned all by yourself. I, your father, am impressed. Why didn't I throw you into the toilet and flush you away when I had the chance？ I see you have a pointy and bitchlike face, how could you perpetrate this polio-esque atrocity on the lines of ancestral massacre? Qingming Festival has passed for a few days already, but due to this incident I still have to pray that your family gets buried with no chicken or dog left behind, and as a icing on the cake, I wish your ancestral graves be submerged by the sea (lit, means "to become a prostitue"), puk gai.

In response to the question "What do you think of the anti-China sentiment in America" on Zhihu, a user posted a guide to sowing discontent against the American authorities on Reddit. Another Reddit user subsequently exposed the trolling attempts on /r/China, along with a translation of the text.

#  Timeline
## The original post
On March 21, 2020, the question  "What do you think of the anti-China sentiment in America" was posted on Zhihu by user ChaNg1o, possibly referring to the rising dissatisfaction against the Chinese government's effort to cover up the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in December 2019. On April 24, (cardicrow)[https://www.zhihu.com/people/cardicrow] responded with a tangentially-related answer that essentially is a field guide to sowing discontent against the American government on Reddit. The answer was well-received, prompting cardicrow to add a screenshot of what he considered as a successful trolling attempt on Reddit to the original answer.

## Exposure on Reddit

On April 29, Reddit user enteirush posted cardicrow's answer, along with an English translation, onto /r/China under the title "[CCP troll exposes his own tactics in /r/coronavirus.](https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/gakn8r/ccp_troll_exposes_his_own_tactics_in_rcoronavirus/)" The post generated over 400 comments and a 97% upvote ratio on /r/China, and was further referenced in 33 other subreddits for discussion.

Enteirush was also able to find the [link](https://archive.is/N2Tx2) to the comment chain that cardicrow touted as an exemplary instance of his public opinion manipulation efforts.

## Original author responds to the exposure

Cardicrow was made aware of the discussion generated by his answer on Reddit. On May 1, he responded: "it turns out Zhihu has been infiltrated after all. My answer is being publicly exhibited on Reddit. The enemy's pretty efficient, lolololol."

# Reception

## Zhihu
Zhihu users highly praised cardicrow's efforts, showering the post with more than 26000 upvotes. 

### Accolades
Three Zhihu users went the extra mile and bestowed a medal (a built-in mechanism of Zhihu) to the answer, commending its "Professionalism." The bestowers include (all information are self-described and public): an accountant, a manager of a tech company in Fuzhou, and a product designer in the San Francisco Bay Area.

## Reddit
Most responses in the /r/China thread derided cardicrow's trolling attempts as feeble, claiming that attacking the US government was something most Americans would do anyway, and it is an integral part of a functioning democracy. A handful of users were baffled by cardicrow's obsession with India, which other users hypothesized was the result of the Chinese people's longstanding contempt and racism against Indians.

Apart from the post in question,  the rest of cardicrow's posts on Zhihu are an eclectic mix of Buddhism, antisemitism, and American Law, with a few single posts on topics ranging from World of Warcraft to cat-rearing sprinkled in-between. 

### a US education for a US basher

Of particular note is cardicrow's answer to the question "Why do some people bash the US yet still apply to study there?" The post shows the mental gymnastics cardicrow had to undertake to assuage his cognitive dissonance of splurging $50,000+ a year in a country he claims to be the 'enemy,' all for a second-rate education (he failed to get into UC Hastings).

Cardicrow wrote:
> If you don't learn from them, how can you overtake them in the future? To take a step back, even if all of our patriotic aspirants stay at home to serve our country, when China's combined national power surpasses that of the United States, shouldn't we lead the world with the power of people who understand the West and have knowledge of America? Shouldn't we learn the strengths of some specific areas of the United States to make ourselves stronger? 
Even Confucius said that if three people walk together, at least one could be our teacher, not to mention learning from the first in the world. There is no shame in this kind of learning, even if the other party is essentially a bully and a robber, his knowledge should be learned, as long as we ourselves do not fall prey to it. 
In additiont to America's technical know-how, we could also learn from areas of America's weakness (referred to as "pits" by cardicrow), understand why they are pits , and how to avoid letting China fall into the same pits. For example, I think the following three are the largest pits of the United States: medicine, finance, and law. Only by gaining a clearer understanding of them can we avoid falling into the same pits. If not, we run the risk of being shrouded by a fog and deceived by the halo of the United States.

## Reddit
Users on /r/China managed to dig out cardicrow's Reddit account. The account in question, [/u/ravensname](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ravensname/) ([archive](https://archive.is/qRhht)), ceased operations after the /r/China exposure. Cardicrow is presumably continuing his trolling efforts under an alt.

ravensname has been active in only three subreddits: /r/Sino, where he made his last post; /r/Coronavirus, which contained the vast majority of his activity; and /r/lawschooladmissions, which corroborated with the interest in US law shown under the Zhihu cardicrow account.

### Failed application to UC Hastings
In an amusing twist, reddit user dontasemebro discovered that ravensname's very first post was one about being booted from the waitlist of UC Hastings, an American law school.
